> "Something exciting is happening here!" 

Balloons infer FUN...ENJOYMENT...PLEASURE! A balloon is filled with happiness and that happiness becomes contagious to everyone who looks upon it. Therefore, we use balloons at parties, weddings and holidays. We use them to draw attention to a grand opening, to draw a crowd to a sale or to a new product.

I have been using symbolic balloons for inspiration. When in a boring meeting or doing something mundane I will visualize a certain color balloon in my mind and begin to pump it up with happy thoughts. Then when sitting alone in my studio I will visualize popping the balloon inside my mind and release all those happy thoughts. Try it...it works for me.
