  "The Red Door" and "Behind The Red Door" are two paintings that were painted

"Behind The Red Door" is a representation of the human interior (psychological or spiritual) aspects; things that go on beyond space and time...that is, behind the red door. This painting, like the unconscious mind, seems to have no top or bottom and can be viewed from any angle. What the viewer sees depends on the viewers personal subconscious. It is signed in all four corners for this reason
