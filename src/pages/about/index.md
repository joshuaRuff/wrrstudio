Symbolism is very important to me. It is the language of the soul. I express symbolism like a preacher, letting it flow like the ocean tide coming in and going out. I call myself an Abstract Symbolic Expressionist because my work testifies to a particular meaning or purpose that exposes individual or corporate aspects and insights of our culture.

I usually do not plan my paintings. They flow from the inside like a daydream or vision, then I creatively interact with that flow. I grab unique insights and significant understanding from this process. I don't know if I would call it spiritual or psychological insight...they are pretty much the same to me.

I've been painting for half a century... Starting when I was in the Navy hospital in Charleston, SC in 1971. I was being discharged for medical reasons and while waiting for my papers I painted several very abstract and symbolic paintings. I have no idea what happened to them, but I have never stopped painting. There have been prolific and dry periods and paintings have been scattered all around the country, many of them un-photographed, undocumented and unremembered.
