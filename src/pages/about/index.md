Art is not about capturing the materialistic side of a subject, it's about capturing the unseen part of the subject. The essence, the emotional, the intellectual; the spirit and soul of the matter is what I'm trying to capture.


Every subject requires its own style of rendering. No two series of paintings should look alike. When I study a subject to paint I try to understand its style... How does it want to be portrayed?... What is its purpose in existing?... What message does it want to send?
